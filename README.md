ðŸ“˜ Human Pangenome Analysis Repository

This repository contains code, data, and visualizations related to my summary and exploration of the research paper:

"A Draft Human Pangenome Reference" â€” Nature, 2023Read the paper here

ðŸ§ª Project Description

This project is part of a Stanford Data Ocean bioinformatics blog assignment. It involves analyzing key results from the Human Pangenome paper and reproducing insights using simulated data in Python.
